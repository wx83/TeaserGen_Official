At Cologne's Food Bank, Georg Rula and Ulf Greber, both retired volunteers, brace themselves for an eight-hour day of distributing food to 10,000 people in need. Amidst recent criticism of food banks turning away foreign newcomers, the initial freeze on new admissions due to aggressive behavior has now been redirected against foreigners, a policy the narrator disagrees with. Despite this, the Cologne Food Bank continues its 90-kilometer tours to collect food from supermarkets for their three distribution centers, including a school that only accepts certain types of food. Georg Brula faces disappointment at a supermarket distribution center due to optimized purchases reducing surplus for food banks, while the number of people in need increases, leading to concerns about insufficient supplies. Doris Ranc, at a distribution center, manages the crowd by organizing the line to prevent arguments, having already collected some fruit. Tensions escalate when Doris refuses to serve a refugee, claiming he is registered elsewhere, leading to a heated exchange and accusations of dishonesty. Two long-time visitors to the center in Ankons, New Germany, express their unhappiness with the influx of migrants, fearing it will make it harder for them to rely on the food bank. Despite facing increased hostility, a shortage of volunteers, and challenges in securing a new location, the dedicated team at the food bank remains committed to ensuring that children receive essential nutritious foods. A Kurdish family, including a German-speaking daughter, waits at a food bank where everyone receives ample food for a small fee, and volunteers like Doris ensure even the sick are cared for, highlighting efforts to prevent hunger in wealthy Germany. How can food banks like the one in Cologne balance the increasing demand for their services with the ethical and logistical challenges of serving a diverse population, including both local residents and foreign newcomers, amidst societal and governmental pressures?
