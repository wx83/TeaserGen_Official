In the sun-soaked streets of Burbank, 22-year-old model and actor DeFi navigates the glitzy yet treacherous Hollywood party scene, hoping to network her way to stardom. Just a few miles away, John, a homeless Vietnam vet, panhandles for drug money, reflecting on the harsh realities behind Hollywood's glamorous facade. Meanwhile, in the working-class area of Commerce, seasoned drug runner El Noda maneuvers through the cartel-influenced drug trade, a stark contrast to the glittering lights of Tinseltown. The complex web of dealers and cartels stretches across Los Angeles, with law enforcement constantly battling to disrupt their operations. A recent drug bust by deputies uncovered methamphetamine sales, while a separate investigation implicated Dr. Nathan Kimmerley, a Hollywood psychiatrist, in the illegal prescription drug trade. Once seduced by Hollywood's allure, Dr. Kimmerley now finds himself a notorious Adderall dealer, his life spiraling into addiction and chaos. The abuse of prescription pills is a growing epidemic in LA, leading to increased heroin addiction and straining law enforcement efforts. Amid this turmoil, the legal marijuana market flourishes, pushing former aspiring actor Yogi, now a struggling marijuana dealer, to the fringes. In the Hollywood Hills, Ramsey, a homeless meth user, clings to the freedom of Tinseltown despite the dangers and recent efforts by deputies to clear out drug users. As offers of shelter and aid go unheeded, many like Ramsey choose the streets, chasing fleeting dreams and temporary relief through drugs. How does the juxtaposition of DeFi's pursuit of Hollywood fame and John's struggle with homelessness and addiction reveal the broader societal issues and contradictions within the glamorous facade of Los Angeles?
