In the blistering summer heat of Athens, where temperatures often soar to a sweltering 40 degrees Celsius, Elini Miri-Vili clutches her water bottle like a lifeline. As Athens' first chief heat officer, Elini Miri-Vili navigates the city's historical underground, including the nearly 20-kilometer-long Hadrian's aqueduct, alongside an Athens Waterworks employee. Elini Miri-Vili's mission is clear: to cool down Athens by implementing engineers' plans for a green belt with 20 water access points in new parks throughout the city. The environmentalists' proposals have spurred Athens Waterworks to modernize, using treated greywater for non-potable purposes, including the Hadrian aqueduct for watering green spaces. Despite the success of the aqueduct project, Athens grapples with heavy traffic, elevated urban temperatures, and the looming threat of forest fires during extreme heat waves. In mid-July, a devastating fire on the northern outskirts of Athens destroyed thousands of houses, underscoring the urgency of Elini Miri-Vili's work. Having experienced the impacts of global warming through her political roles, Elini Miri-Vili chose to focus on cities, believing they hold both the major problems and solutions. Elini Miri-Vili often develops her innovative solutions and concepts through collaborative meetings in air-conditioned cafes, acknowledging that her office's lack of parks and green spaces, significant elderly population, and heat-absorbing surfaces exacerbate the heat problem. Athens faces a deadly combination of hot summers and circulatory problems among the elderly, but Elini Miri-Vili remains hopeful that the city's decline can be halted. How can Elini Miri-Vili's innovative approach to urban cooling and green infrastructure in Athens serve as a model for other cities facing similar climate challenges?
