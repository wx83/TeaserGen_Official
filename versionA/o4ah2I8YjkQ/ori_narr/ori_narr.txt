 The main actors in this production of the New Testament are migrants.  It's a political project by the Swiss director Milo Rao.  Antonina Shuku is Nigerian.  He's a Christian and he's playing an apostle.  I joined this project because I believe it's very good for the Africa's, for the immigrants  who are here in Italy, who are working in the feudal getting less.  It is a project that combines art and politics in the European Capital of Culture  Mateira in southern Italy.
