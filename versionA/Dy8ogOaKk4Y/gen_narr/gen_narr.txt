In January 2019, the World Economic Forum in Davos buzzed with anticipation as a Dutch historian took the stage, spotlighting the glaring issue of tax avoidance by the super-rich. Jeff Bezos' astonishingly low tax rate served as a prime example, underscoring how this systemic problem deepens inequality. The historian argued that true wealth creation hinges on essential workers, a reality starkly highlighted by the pandemic. Meanwhile, in Primeville, Facebook's significant presence, marked by generous donations and tax breaks, had transformed the town's economy and political landscape, raising alarms about corporate influence.

Retailers, feeling compelled to partner with Amazon despite its domineering terms, found themselves at the mercy of the e-commerce giant. Tech behemoths like Apple exerted similar control over their platforms, charging substantial fees that some entrepreneurs likened to mafia tactics. The era of surveillance capitalism dawned, with Apple, Facebook, and Google leveraging user data for profit, sparking antitrust lawsuits and societal concerns. As the European Union introduced the Digital Service Act and Digital Markets Act to curb tech giants' power, intense lobbying efforts ensued, highlighting the ongoing battle between private interests and government accountability. How can governments effectively balance the need to regulate the immense power of mega-corporations like Google, Facebook, and Amazon while fostering innovation and economic growth, especially in light of their significant influence on democratic processes and market dynamics?
