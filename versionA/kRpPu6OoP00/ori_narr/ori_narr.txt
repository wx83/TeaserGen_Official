 Taliban fighters rule the streets, armed with weapons once used by their enemies.  We see them all over Kabul.  The Taliban's return to power has changed millions of lives, especially the lives of  Afghan women.  I feel like a prisoner, nothing is in my own hands anymore, before I could do whatever I wanted.  Of course, I'm very much happy.  You know, the head is no war.  We are living like other people in the world.  The Taliban are back and so is their ideology, but what's it like living in today's  Afghanistan?
