The journey west from Kabul to the war-torn province of Maidan-Wardak was fraught with memories of conflict and hope. Dr. Rochanak Wardak, a former politician and Taliban supporter, welcomed us into her small home clinic. Once a gynecologist with dreams of a parliamentary Afghanistan, Dr. Rochanak now witnesses the lingering scars of war in her patients' eyes. The cessation of fighting has brought a fragile peace, but the cultural emphasis on having boys for family power remains. Some of the boys Dr. Rochanak helped deliver are now fighters, a stark reminder of the cycle of conflict. Dr. Rosha Nakh, working for the Taliban in female and maternal health, dreams of a shift in the regime's stance on women's activities. However, the male-dominated reality and widespread poverty in Kabul cast a long shadow over her hopes. The Taliban blame international sanctions for the hunger crisis, focusing more on controlling women's lives than addressing economic issues. Young women like Aisha, once aspiring doctors, now feel lost and hopeless, their dreams crushed by the Taliban's ban on secondary education for girls. In the mountain village of Istarlif, traditional potter Abdul Manan and his son Ramish struggle to sustain their family craft amidst severe restrictions on visitors. Abdul Manan's fear for his livelihood and safety underscores the persistent threat to their peaceful existence, a poignant reminder of the ongoing conflicts that continue to shape Afghanistan's future. How does Dr. Rochanak Wardak reconcile her support for the Taliban with her aspirations for a progressive Afghanistan, especially in light of the Taliban's restrictive policies on women's education and activities?
