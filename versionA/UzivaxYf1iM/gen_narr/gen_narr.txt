In the heart of the Chharia mines, 17-year-old Savitri Mato and 9-year-old Chhotu navigate a world fraught with peril. The industrial hum has ceased, leaving the siblings to scavenge coal by hand, a dangerous task that has become their daily reality. The threat of police intervention looms over them, branding their struggle for survival as theft. Yet, driven by sheer determination, Savitri and Chhotu labor tirelessly, their small frames burdened with the weight of coal and urgency. The coal mining industry, despite its devastating environmental and health impacts, is a lifeline for around 30,000 impoverished souls in the region. For Savitri, the fires that have raged underground for over a century are both a curse and a source of meager income. Her dream of breaking free from poverty through education is constantly under siege by financial hardships, forcing her family to cut back on essentials. Despite arriving late to class, Savitri finds solace in the acceptance of her best friend Alicia, whose affluent family knows nothing of such struggles. The narrator's pride and concern for Savitri are palpable, especially given the dangerous conditions near the mines where Savitri's mother was once injured. Amidst the chaos, the family grapples with the father's illness, and the children, including young Chhotu, find fleeting moments of respite. As Savitri and Chhotu face a massive, life-threatening fire for the first time, their hearts are a tumultuous mix of fear and awe, silently praying for divine intervention. How do the dangerous conditions and legal challenges faced by young coal scavengers like Savitri Mato and Chhotu in the Jharia mines reflect the broader socio-economic and environmental issues in the region?
