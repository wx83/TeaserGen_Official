 Subitrimato works as a coal scavenger. It's a tough job for a teenager. It's also dangerous, illegal, and a health hazard.  Coal also has disastrous consequences for the climate. India is already among the world's top polluters.  Every morning, Subitrimato retails for hours in the mines of Charya in eastern India.  It's the country's coal belt, where tens of thousands of people struggle to make a living.  Subitrimato has to work in the mines to sustain her family and pay for college.
