In the coastal village of Averro, Portugal, Fito Cacere, a fisherman from a lineage of seafarers, battles the relentless forces of climate change and coastal erosion that threaten his livelihood. Meanwhile, in Apulia, Adriano Rivera, a seasoned fisherman of 55 years, grapples with the devastating impact of a government-constructed stone breakwater that erodes the sand dunes and endangers local homes and seafood restaurants. Adriano listens intently as Abel Viera, a restaurant owner, voices his fears about the local council's plans to demolish the food mile, a move that could cripple the region's economy and cost countless jobs. Viera suggests relocating the restaurants to safer grounds, while Joao Paolo, a surf camp owner, worries about the shrinking beach that jeopardizes his business. As the sea advances, the once-thriving beach community faces economic ruin, forcing relocations and raising urgent questions about the future. In Esmerich, Vitor, a politically active mediator, assists Kala Santosh and her children in moving from their vulnerable seaside home to a newly built settlement inland, offering them a fresh start. Portugal's battle against coastal erosion involves costly beach nourishment projects, transferring sand from the seabed to the shores, a measure closely watched by local leaders and residents. Joao, an environmental instructor, educates his students on the ongoing coastal erosion, emphasizing the failures of current sand replenishment efforts and the severe impact of climate change and construction errors. Ishmaresh Vitault, a town counselor candidate, engages with residents affected by rising sea levels, highlighting past efforts and ongoing commitments to protect their homes. Despite the challenges, the community remains hopeful, debating solutions to coastal erosion, including new housing and breakwaters, while Adriano passionately advocates for a project to safeguard Apulia's dunes and community from the existential threat. How can the Portuguese government balance the immediate needs of coastal communities like Averro and Apulia with long-term sustainable solutions to combat coastal erosion and climate change?
