 Every morning starts the same, coffee and crosswork.  And over day things seem to get boosts.  Religious conflict, climate change.  It all seems so apocalyptic.  None of this is new, however.  We've been predicting at the end of the world for thousands of years.  From those dramas all the way back to the book of Revelation.  Something about the drama of annihilation seems to equip us.  Is it just human nature to worry in one for about the end of days?  How is it really coming?  I'm setting off on a journey.  To find out why so many religions predict an apocalypse.  This beast has a human name.  Its number is 666.  To discover the roots of judgment day.  The sons of light shall battle the sons of darkness.  Our ancient prophecies.  There's hope peace between us and our neighbors.  Reverberate today.  If these guys ever came to power, it would be hellna.  Ask whether the end is really what we imagine.  Or if it's all just in our minds.
