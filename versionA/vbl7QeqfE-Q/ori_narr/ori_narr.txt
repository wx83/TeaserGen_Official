 Just opened up my book, started reading the first sentence of the paragraph.  When I heard what sounded like freight train coming through my bedroom,  I jumped out of the bed, and then there was a pumping sound that was  consecutively got much faster.  And with each thumb, I felt the rig actually shaped.  Then that was my initial bones, the lights went out.  And there's a huge explosion.  The explosion rocked the rig about 10 o'clock central time,  spraying flames in every direction.  Well, I saw fire from Derek Lake to Derek Lake.  And you have oil and gas under pressure,  underground that erupts upward.  It was extremely loud.  It actually started sounding like a living thing.  It's the sound of escaping gas,  feeding the fireball,  and generating the deep water horizon.  It's like you're almost waiting to die.  There's people screaming.  We feel the heat from the fire.  I'm scared to death.  I figured this is my time.  I'm going to die.  126 people were on board at the time of the explosion.  Some jump or then 70 fine feet into the ocean.  The coastguard is pressing it search today,  where 11 workers still missing.  I started to have a bad feeling  when the sun came off.  It got very precarious with that time.  Time was running out.
